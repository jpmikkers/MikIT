# MikIT

MikIT is a 'mod' musicplayer for the following file formats:

- IT (impulse tracker)
- XM (fasttracker)
- MOD (protracker)
- S3M (screamtracker)
- DCM (midi-ish module format used most notably in the N64 game [Tetrisphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetrisphere)

This repo is a working build from the original sources [here](https://sourceforge.net/projects/mikit/), but the example program only includes the WAV file render driver. Older soundcard drivers such as soundblaster and directx5 can be found in the `unused` folder.
